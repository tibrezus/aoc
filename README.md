# Adventure of Code (AOC)

## 2023 - The Zig Chronicles

Hello fellow code adventurers! I'm embarking on a quest to broaden my coding horizons, and I've chosen Zig as my trusty companion on this journey. My pursuit began with a simple goal: learn a new language. But as fate would have it, my path took an unexpected turn.

Armed with my MacBook, I eagerly set out to install Zig, only to be met with a formidable adversary - a compatibility issue unique to the latest macos. Undeterred, I saw this as an opportunity to not just learn Zig, but to also dive deep into the realm of cloud-based development. Thus, the Adventure of Code (AOC) project was born.

## The Structure of Our Quest

This project is a tapestry of daily coding challenges, each a unique story in the grand saga of Zig. Picture a vast library of directories, each dated and named like chapters in an epic (e.g., `23/01/Trebuchet`). Every folder is a self-contained adventure, complete with its own Zig code, tests, and data.

## Embracing the Cloud with GitHub Actions

Facing the limitations of my local setup, I turned to the cloud - a realm where possibilities are endless. Here, GitHub Actions became my powerful ally, enabling me to automate the entire lifecycle of each challenge. This cloud-based forge handles the compilation, testing, and release of my code, making my MacBook a mere portal to this vast digital workshop.

Each challenge, a distinct quest in itself, is equipped with its own set of automated processes, ensuring that every modification weaves seamlessly into the tapestry of AOC.

### The Power of GitHub Actions

In this realm, GitHub Actions is like a wizard, casting spells that automate workflows across various environments. It's not just a tool; it's an extension of my coding will, ensuring that my creations are robust, platform-agnostic, and ever-evolving.
